		<h3>Website review of Wikipedia's FAQ page</h3>
		<p> Originally I wanted to do my review on eBay.com, but I couldn’t find their FAQ page. So, I decided to try Wikipedia. Low and behold I found it. 
		</p>
		<p> To answer the question posed in the assignment; yes it does use fragment identifiers. The page easy to navigate, simple and not to flashy. The color scheme is pleasant. It is informative and easy to use.
		I ran it through the validator and it came up with only 13 errors and 5 warnings. That’s impressive when you look at all the code that goes into that one webpage.
		</p>
