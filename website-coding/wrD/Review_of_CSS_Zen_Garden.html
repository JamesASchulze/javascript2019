				<p> I think my favorite design is &quot;Steel&quot; by Steffen Knoeller. It doesn&apos;t have much color, but who says it has to to be cool? I really like the animation of the boards moving down and forward. One thing though, when I clicked on the links to check the validity of both the HTML and the CSS, they didn't work. <span class=span>&quot;No Referer header found!&quot;</span> So, I copy and pasted the URL into the validator and it worked. It only had four warnings.
