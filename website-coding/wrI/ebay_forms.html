				<h2>Website Review</h2>
				<p>This website review is on <a href="https://www.ebay.com/"><span class="span">ebay.com</span></a>. Ebay, or eBay, is a great website for finding deals and selling one&apos;s old junk. One man&apos;s junk is another&apos;s treasure, or that&apos;s how the saying goes anyway. It truly is amazing what people will try to sell. I&apos;ve heard of people selling a half eaten sandwich, and what is worse, someone bought it! Well, enough of that. In order to buy or sell on eBay one must have a account. To sign up for an account is easy, all you need to do is enter an email address, password, first name, last name, phone number, and the way you will be paying for items. If you want to receive your items you will need to enter your home address or PO box number. How does eBay get this information from you?... Forms. They are a great and easy way to get the right data to the right place... unless you get hacked, then it&apos;s not so hot.</p>
			
				<p>While I was attempting to validate the HTML, I discovered that ebay is using HTML4. So, I couldn&apos;t successfully check the accuracy of the developers. Oh well.</p>
