			<h2>Website Review</h2>
			<p>This website review is on <a href="https://www.atheismexposed.tripod.com/"><span class="span">atheismexposed.com</span></a>. When I found this site, it was like a wormhole to the past. I saw colors and page layouts which I had not seen in many moons. It seemed I was back in the 90&apos;s! I began to look at the HTML and it was at that point in which I realized why CSS is so convenient. This &quot;tbody&quot; had this &quot;tr&quot;, which had this &quot;td&quot;, which had this &quot;p&quot;, which had a &quot;span&quot; and a &quot;b&quot;, with a &quot;span&quot; of it own; not to mention the text color, background color, font size, spacing and all the other stylistic data to make a web page somewhat esthetically pleasing. People are very creative and can do some amazing things with strict parameters. It seems to me that HTML5 and CSS allow more options and flexibility as well as making it easier to have consistency through out the site.</p>
