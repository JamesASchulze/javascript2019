			<h1>A Ice vs Liquid design Website review</h1>
		</header>
		<div>
			<p>To compare these two styles of website design I chose two different church websites.
			<h2>Ice design</h2>
			<p>I found that <a href="http://www.lakewayonline.org">www.lakewayonline.org</a> uses the Ice design style. It has all the information in the middle of the page. It works fine when stretching it out, but it does run into issues when shrinking it. I checked to see if it has a mobile version and it does. I can&apos;t say that it is a site I would want to stay a while on, but on the flip side, it isn&apos;t grotesque to look at. I doesn&apos;t look like it is designed with millennial&apos;s in mind.</p>


			<h2>Liquid design</h2>
			<p>I believe <a href="http://www.gracewaygb.org">www.gracewaygb.org</a> uses more of the liquid design. As you stretch and shrink the browser window it moves the pictures and text into the proper placement, for easy viewing. It uses &quot;Wordpress&quot; which works really well and is convenient. I did notice a few things that could be changed, like the little picture next to the title; it still shows the Wordpress W. And there were a few pages that were not used, one still had the example paragraph underneath the navigation bar. The color scheme is bright and works well.</p>


			<h3>Closing thoughts</h3>
			<p>Both sites were informative and easy to navigate. I liked the liquid design better, because it worked well no matter what size you have your browser at. But honestly, how many people have their browsers shrunk to a quarter of the screen? When you boil it down, a talented web developer can use either one and make a great looking website.</p>
