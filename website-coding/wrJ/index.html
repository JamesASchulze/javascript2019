				<h2>Website Review</h2>
				<p>This website review is on <a href="https://www.lego.com/en-us/starwars/videos/lego-star-wars-rogue-one-buildable-figures-2b688669abc64b2aa148adfb9c65b059?icmp=COUS46HomeFEStarWarsProduct"><span class="span">lego.com</span></a>.</p>
				<p>This looks like a lego/starwars website should. You've got the childish, yet fun lego antics with the well known and loved starwars characters. I enjoyed clicking around and watching the videos. There are so many. It would be really easy to sit and watch all of the videos on here. I think they did a good job at mingling the brands together. </p>
			
				<p>I think it was a wise decision for the developers to use the video tag instead of flash. One reason is, flash is dying out. Not to mention, it is notorious for security risks. Developers just don&apos;t need flash anymore, there are other options out there now.</p>
