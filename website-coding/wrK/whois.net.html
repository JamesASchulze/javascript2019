				<h2>Website Review</h2>
				<p>This website review is on <a href="https://www.whois.net"><span class="span">whois.net</span></a>.</p>
				<p>So, I checked out a few domain names to see If I could get one. I tried James.com and it&apos;s has already been taken(shocker). It has been taken since January 9th, 1995. While looking at the page, I saw over to the right, other names that are available like, james.ninja ($16) or james.lol ($33). Wow &#8208;shakes head&#8208; I also tried jamess.com, again taken. Someone is selling jamessparker.com for $3443.00 (I'm not sure what to do with that). And, finally I tried jamesschulze.com, which is actually available, for $12.99. I checked to see what &quot;Fun and Unique&quot; domains were available and I got jamesschulze.fail... for $24.60. Well there you have it, I have a cheep and boring name. Oh well, it is what it is.</p>
			
				<p>This site is simple and functional. It has very few pages: five or six, that I found. I was looking at the HTML and noticed the Google analytics meta tag in the head section, which was mentioned in class. I also saw tables and other element tags, of which I now know what they mean! I'm learning! Thanks Professor Bob!</p>
