			<h2>Website Review</h2>
		<div id="assign" class="green">
			<p>Today my website review is on thumbnails. More specifically, thumbnails which link to the full size image. There are a plethora of sites that incorporate thumbnails into their web page&apos;s like, eBay, Amazon, and just about any other &quot;store&quot;. So, I chose the store page at <a href="https://answersingenesis.org/store/pruduct/noah-man-destiny/?sku=10-2-477">www.answersingenesis.org</a>.</p> 

			<p>A thumbnail is a small version of a larger image. They are useful when optimizing a web page. Because the file size is not as big the page can load faster. This would be a nightmare for sites such as I mentioned earlier. On store sites, they typically use a lot of photos to describe the available products. They can be used to show damage or flaws on a product or to verify it&apos;s condition.</p>

			<p> The store page on <a href="https://answersingenesis.org/store/">www.answersingenesis.org</a> is no different, they use thumbnails and short descriptions on a page in which there are many different items for sale. using this technique is a great way to make your site go faster and make it easier for viewers to find what they are looking for.</p>
