				<h2>Competitive Stapling</h2>
				<p>This year's competitive stapling event features athletes from 13 countries and split between two categories.</p>
				<h3>Fastest Stapling</h3>
				<p>Athletes will be timed in stapling two reams worth of paper in groups of 14 sheets of paper using a standard-issued stapler. The paper must be hand-counted and stapled using a non-automated stapler by individual. This is not a team-event. There will be age classes in this event, and medals will be awarded by age class:
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Women &amp; Men, Ages 15-30</li>
					<li>Women &amp; Men, Ages 30-45</li>
					<li>Women &amp; Men, Ages 45-60</li>
				</ul>

				<h3>Weight Stapling</h3>
				<p>In this event, athletes will compete to see how can staple the thickest packet of paper using a standard-issued stapler. Should the staple not protrude through the back of the last sheet of paper, the athlete will be disqualified. This is certainly a risky event, as there are no second chances. One staple--that's all each athlete gets. For this event, there are weight brackets by gender:In this event, athletes will compete to see how can staple the thickest packet of paper using a standard-issued stapler.
