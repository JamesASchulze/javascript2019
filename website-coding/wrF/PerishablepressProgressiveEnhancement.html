			<h1>Perishablepress.com: Review(progressive enhancement)</h1>
			<h2>Website Review</h2>
			<p>Today my website review topic is on progressive enhancement. The website ,<a href="https://perishablepress.com/css3-progressive-enhancement-smart-design/"><span class="span">https://perishablepress.com/css3-progressive-enhancement-smart-design/</span></a>. I found this blog post to be informative and well done. It included many examples of css3 and how it makes the job of a web developer easier.</p> 

			<p>To be honest, I wasn't quite sure what progressive enhancement actually was, but now I think I understand it (at least a little better). It means working on your website to keep it up to date with the latest and greatest web browsers while not completely ignoring the lesser (older) browsers. However, a company can&apos;t keep throwing money at maintenance for IE7 or even 8 (which was released ten years ago). One must draw the line somewhere. Sometimes it means completely ignoring a whole browser i.e. IE (pun intended).</p>
